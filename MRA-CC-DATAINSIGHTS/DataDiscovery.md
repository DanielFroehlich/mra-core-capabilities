## Data Discovery

Data discover allow for consumers of data of the platform to be able
to understand which data products are available within the platform,
how to use them (APIs etc.) and any constraints on usage (legal,
operational etc.). This capability can be realized from a system
perspective (through data discovery APIs) or a human consumption
perspective (e.g. data cataloguing, search and publishing). This
capability is important within the manufacturing platform to
understand what data is available across processes, its provenance,
operational constraints and access patterns.

Additional information like provenance, operational constraint,
ownership, and access restrictions are being made available by the
platform to further refine the discovery process.

To improve data discovery cataloguing solutions are usually covering the
entire enterprise. The platform therefore must enable the integration of
corporatewide solutions. An example scenario is the evaluation of part
range which is requiring the combination of logistics and production
domain data.
