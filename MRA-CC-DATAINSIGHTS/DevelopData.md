## Develop Data

The capability to use data efficiently and effectively within the
manufacturing platform.

### Distributed Query

Distributed data queries provide a common mechanism that allows data
to be queried and processed across multiple instances of storage
technologies and/or partitions of data. This capability ensures that
data can be used across the range of technologies in the manufacturing
platform independent of its underlying storage technology.

### Data Labs

The ability for data engineers and scientists to have data sets and
environment for them to perform valid and appropriate analytics within
the manufacturing platform.

### Feature Store

The capability and process to construct, manage and execute known,
operationally valid models within the data platform.
