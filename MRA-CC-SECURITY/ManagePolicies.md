## Manage Policies

Security policy are set of rules that define the security objectives in
terms of what should be protected from whom under which the conditions.
A platform must provide effective monitoring of these policies and sure
their enforcement. Security policies inherently help to standardize
their enforcements across organization in a consistent way. Industry
specific governmental and regulatory requirements (e.g., NIST, HIPPA)
might apply additionally. Security policy have broad impact on elements
like system resources, authentication & authorization, system Integrity
and many others.

Regular and sometimes continuous auditing is needed to ensure compliance
with security policies, to avoid security posture degrade over time.

### Security Policies

Security policy are set of rules that define the security objectives
in terms of what do we want to protect, from whom, and the conditions.
Effective monitoring of policies in terms of effectiveness and
enforcement is important. Security policies help standardize the
enforcements across organization in a consistent way. Depending upon
industries, there may be a need to align the policies with
governmental and regulatory requirements (e.g. NIST, HIPPA). Security
policy would broadly control: System resources, Authentication,
Authorization, Data Integrity, System Integrity, Auditing,
Confidentiality.

### Network Policies

Network policy is a specific kind of Security Policy, which define the
rules that govern the behaviors of network and connected devices.
Having the ability to define policy for network also helps to automate
and respond more quickly at the network level on the changing security
requirement and posture. Broadly various policies under this cover:
Access to network, resources access, allowed applications, define and
allocate Quality of Service, traffic routing and control

### Auditing

Auditing is needed to make sure that the security posture doesn't
degrade over time. Ideally auditing needs to be aligned to some of the
industry standard benchmarks (e.g., Center for Internet Security
(CIS), OWASP, ISA/IEC 62443 etc.). This industry alignment helps to
improve the security program as it allows the learnings across the
wider industry space and also helps compare the security state with
other peers. So even if the current security program is not tied to
any of these standard benchmarks, it still will give a good guidance
to define own program and compare with what others are doing. However,
another aspect which is also important is that after the definition of
these, there has to be a capability available to continuously assess,
review, and monitor the compliance status across the space under
scope.

### Secure the Software Supply Chain

Secure Software Supply Chain is in theory good imperative policy
target, but reality shows it is often not doable or an illusion. There
may be contractual and due diligence things that can be done in the
supply chain, but reality shows that you cannot trust software that
you bought, that your 3rd party ISV is always guaranteed error free.
Also an in-house development team is vulnerable to Typosquatting type
of attacks and can introduce inadvertently malicious code.

A secure software supply chain (SSSC) defines and enforces standards
for the whole chain â€“ from sourcing of base images, libraries,
frameworks, 3d party software via static code analysis and security
scanning to deployment and operations. As new vulnerability are
identified after deployment, continuous scanning is required to be
alerted and necessary controls can be activated.
