## Connect Third Parties

Several Third Parties might need access to different parts of the
platform. Examples are

-   Suppliers to update on status of order / deliveries

-   ISV to support a SaaS deployment model on premises

-   OEM of control system helping with diagnostic/maintenance/optimising
    tasks

-   SIs providing manages services

Depending on the level of integration, different other capabilities are
needed to implement this. Examples are:

-   API Management and Identity and Access Management to provide secure
    access to an API to provide updates on shipment status for a
    supplier

-   Manage Communication to provide VPN access to the OT network for an
    Control System OEM to help with trouble shooting
