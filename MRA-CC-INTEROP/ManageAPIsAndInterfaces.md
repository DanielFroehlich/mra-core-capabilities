## Manage APIS and Interfaces

API management is a key platform capability and involves the
distribution, control, and analysis of APIs that connect applications
and data across the enterprise and from cloud to cloud.

Changing configurations on shop floor level is a complex process due to
the vast amount of legacy systems. Therefore, the platform must provide
a sophisticated versioning of APIs. If things go wrong the platform must
provide an intuitive way to evaluate the change history.

Communication patterns are rarely documented at shop floor level today.
API management solutions can eliminate this issue by analysing
communication patterns and optionally enforcing communication policies.

### Provide API Gateways

Decentralised gateway components keep track of communication
relationships, API usage and are the point of policy enforcement

### Provide API Administration

A centralised component where API providers and consumer administrate
the APIs and their usage. Define Endpoint, Register Client, Monitor
Usage, monitoring and chargeback. Versioning etc. Is managed here.
