## Manage Data

Manage includes all areas that relate to ensuring that data is thought
of as an asset within a manufacturing company and its data platform.
These capabilities may follow guidance and be operationalized within
existing standards and data frameworks (such as ISO 8000/25012/27701,
DANA-DMBoK and EDM Council Maturity Framework).

To derive meaning from information it must be structured beforehand.
Data models give data structure and include all technical
characteristics (the structural format and content of the data, access
protocols etc.) as well as operational characteristics (metadata, data
ownership etc.).

The structuring process is executed by transforming, conforming
(applying consistent data semantics and business rules) and mapping data
from multiple sources into a common semantic data model. This model
captures common metadata, attributes, and entity definitions (and their
navigable relationships) to allow applications and data users to be able
use it across multiple systems, processes plants and devices in a
consistent, meaningful way.

Data product is a term gaining popularity recently. It is emphasizing
the value of the data and the target of achieving (virtual) revenues
with the consumption of this data. It is therefore considered as an
extension of the expression data asset.

The importance of this capability is underscored by the existence of a
dedicated OMP semantic data structuring working group.

### Semantic Data Modelling

Data models are the definition of curated data products that may be
used and consumed by the applications. This includes all technical
characteristics (the structural format and content of the data, access
protocols etc.) as well as operational characteristics (metadata, data
ownership etc.). Models and data products may be aligned by their
usage characteristics (events, documents, relational etc.). OMP
provides data model standards and recommendations via its [semantic
data structure working
group](https://openmanufacturingplatform.github.io/sds-documentation/sds-documentation/index.html).

### Data Governance

Data governance capabilities ensures that data can used across the
manufacturing platform in an operationally valid and appropriate
manner. This capability includes the technical, process and human
mechanisms to achieve this (such as data custodianship and data
stewardship).

### Reference and Master Data

The ability to define, catalogue and organize authoritative sets of
non-transactional, consistent data and their core attributes within
the manufacturing platform. This is important for defining and
understanding data taxonomies in the manufacturing platform (such as
asset, organization and geographic hierarchies).

### Metadata

This capability ensures that the metadata of data is captured and used
appropriately within the platform. This includes metadata derived from
source (e.g. plant equipment) and derived metadata (such as the OMP
Data Definition Aspect Model).

### Data Quality

The capability that ensures that the veracity of data can be
understood, quantified, and so, if necessary, improved within the
system. This capability includes both technical data quality
capabilities and support (such as outlier detection) as well as
process capabilities (such as manual human in the loop inspection of
data).

### Data Security

The capability to ensure that data is controlled, retained and
accessible to permitted systems and users at an appropriate level of
granularity within defined legal and operational policies.

A compliant usage of data requires that data is controlled, retained and
accessible to permitted systems and users at an appropriate level of
granularity within defined legal and operational policies. The challenge
is to define the right level of appropriateness. Quite often data
security initiatives do not factor in the cost of policy maintenance and
enforcement. This is leading to complex policies that are trimmed down
later in the execution phase and create a lot of frustration with the
users that must cope with it. A detailed data usage logging can be much
more efficient as it is not restricting data access but making data
consumption transparent.
