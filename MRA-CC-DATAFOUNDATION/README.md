# Data Foundation

The Data Foundation capabilities ensure that all data across the
manufacturing platform can be reliably stored, integrated, operated on
and managed. Implementing this capability serves as a baseline for being
able to then turn the raw data into insights and actions, which is
another top-level capability.

Sub-Capabilities are:
* [Integrate Data](IntegrateData.md)
* [Persist Data](PersistData.md)
* [Compute Data](ComputeData.md)
* [Manage Data](ManageData.md)
