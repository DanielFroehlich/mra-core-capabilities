## Manage Device Fleets

Devices are usually being rolled out at large scale. Thus, the platform
must be able to operate and handle the resulting complexity. A key
driver for the device architecture is the desired availability of the
devices. For high availability, backup resources must usually be
available to cover hardware defects. This is typically easier to
accomplish in datacenters than close to the production assets. The
platform therefore must support different deployment scenarios and
efficient transitions between them.
