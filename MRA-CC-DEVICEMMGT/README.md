# Device Management \[Maintainer: Daniel, Content: Lukas\]

In contrast to production assets which are providing direct value to the
manufacturing process, devices are defined as being IT infrastructure
components. The main goals of the devices are data collection and
sending information back to the production assets. Thus, devices are
equipment like sensors, gateways, industrial PCs. PLCs are part of both
worlds: They are part of the production asset and a device as well as
they are communicating directly with the infrastructure. A platform must
be able to support this hybrid existence and enable new trends like
software defined automation and PLCs.
