# Application Enablement

Applications are the only means by which users can experience a
production platform. Applications are turning platform capabilities into
business value based on the use cases implemented. A wide range of
application architectures needs to be supported: from traditional N-tier
architectures to modern micro-services, event driven and low code
architectures.

Most applications are relying on the underlying platform capabilities,
e.g., interoperability for async messaging, data storage or event
processing.

In the complex manufacturing IT landscape professional dependency and
lifecycles management are key elements of the platform.

Level two capabilities are:
- [Develop Applications](DevelopApplications.md)
- [Deploy Applications](DeployApplications.md)
- [Serve Applications](ServeApplications.md)
- [Manage Business Process Execution](ManageBusinessProcessExecution.md)
- [Operate Systems And Applications](OperateSystemsAndApplications.md)
