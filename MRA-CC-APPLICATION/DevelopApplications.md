## Develop Applications

While many manufacturing applications are COTS (like SCADA, MES or WMS)
every plant is additionally more or less depending on custom-built
solutions. These solutions are developed both in-house and from external
partners. In any case the platform must provide a professional
continuous integration (CI) approach to enable this distributed
development approach. This is even more important in regulated
environments.

### Developer Tooling

Tools for developing applications are needed. From traditional tooling
running on the PC of the developer, to cloud based or low code tooling.

### Support Low Code Application Development

Low code application development provides a fast and easy approach for
simple applications like custom inventory management. Experienced
business users can create these (data entry) applications without IT
support. The challenge of this “grass root” approach is keeping these
solutions in a manageable state. If these applications become too
complex, they are much harder to maintain than classical development
approaches. The platform must therefore enable an optional integration
of low code application and provide mechanism to support an low-code to
non-low-code evolution.

### Manage Application Lifecycle

For a more complex application environment, lifecycle tooling to keep
track of requirements, software assest, their dependencies could be
required.
